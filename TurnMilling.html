                            <p>*Because of the non-disclosure agreement (NDA), the real interface, market information, software structure cannot be revealed in this portfolio.</p>
                            <p>There are two common types of CNC (computer numerical control) machines: lathe and milling machines. If a workpiece has turning and milling features, the workpiece has to be processed separately on lathe and milling machines. Since it has to be removed and installed on another machine, the process lowered efficiency and precision. The turn-milling machine integrates two processing methods so that the workpiece can be processed on one machine. As a result, turn-milling machines can bring higher efficiency and precision.</p>
                            <p>Syntec Technology Co., Ltd., Taiwan’s leading machine controller manufacturing company, gained a high market share in the turn-milling machine in China. The company paid a high cost for customer service since the clients often used improper NC files (machine instruction files) on the controller. Therefore, Syntec wanted to offer a solution for the clients to effortlessly generate NC files for machining.</p>

                            <p>There were three reasons for processing failure: NC file, controller, and machine. When users produced unexpected shapes or poor surface quality, it was not easy for them to identify the cause of the failure. Due to the good customer service provided by Syntec, customers often request services for troubleshooting. Field application engineers spend a long time reproducing and analyzing the problems. The company paid a high cost for customer service, even if the problems were not caused by the controller. By the record of customer services, improper NC files were high frequency reasons.</p>

                            <p>The CAD/CAM software was for assisting users in producing NC files. Because of complexity, the turn-milling CAD/CAM software was generally not easy-to-use for the novice. For example, it was necessary to set parameters for different machines, so users must have detailed knowledge of the machines. Some clients who lacked specific knowledge often generated inappropriate NC files due to misuse of the software. As a result, they processed unexpected workpieces.</p>
                            <p>In order to solve the problems, the company planned to offer CAD/CAM software for customers. Since the software guided the user to generate the NC file compatible with our controllers, the cost of tutorials and customer service could be reduced. In addition, the integration experience would also increase the customer's stickiness to our brand.</p>

                                        <li>Controller version: it is a conversational window on the controller. The interface guides users to generate workpieces. Since the software was embedded in the controller, users don’t have to set complicated machine settings on the software.</li>

                            <p>Since the cooperating customers were rich-in practical experience in manufacturing, I visited clients and conducted interviews. The clients displayed how they generated NC files and put the file on machines to execute. I observed some details which were not easy to know when only asking online. For instance, the clients used the software in their office and transferred the files to the plant. File management was one of the problems. Moreover, highly experienced operators generated some complicated NC files without the assistance of CAD/CAM software. It allows me to consider the difference in the ability of users.</p>
                            <p>Also, some clients were experienced in using CAD/CAM software. I prepared some questions about their usage habits and the reason of choosing specific software. Besides, the clients provided me for some common workpiece they produced via turn-milling machine. Those workpieces enables me to examine the competitive products by try to generate NC files for them. I evaluated the integrated experience on operating the products.</p>
                            <p>→ Their feedback allows me to design the milestone for each stage of development process. Set measurable design target for each stage and keep it attractive for clients.</p>

                            <p>Also, I drew the layout as a rough draft. Display layouts allow teams to discuss and provide constructive feedback practically. For example, a co-worker pointed out, “It should add some illustrations to describe the meaning of parameters.” Or, he said, “There are too many options. The menu bar should hide some items below to make a clear interface.”</p>

                            <p>The software structure planning facilitated our team to think about the big picture for our programs. In the implementation phase, we cooperated with another team. The structure diagram helped us to discuss and distribute the workload. It was an effective tool for defining the expected interactions between each component and delegating responsibility to each component clearly.</p>

                            <p>In the development process, involving users in the process was helpful. To get user feedback as quickly as possible, the main idea to set the milestone of each step was to coherent the whole process first. To be more specific, I chose to complete the entire workflow for an easy task rather than implementing many complex operations at one time.</p>
                            <p>For example, generating NC file requires steps: bulid 3D model, detect features, define operations, build machine, ...etc. </p>
